# Turn it Around site migration and redesign

Turn it Around offers resources around bullying for teachers and counselors, mainly in middle and high-schools. They try to work directly with these teachers and counselors to educate them on what to do when kids are being bullied.

# Project Goals
This project will redesign the current Turn it Around website to allow the organization to expand its reach and to offer more granular resources for counselors and students in daycares, community centers, schools, and college campuses.

# Project Summary
The Special Projects Team will migrate the site from Drupal to WordPress and create a new design that follows Turn it Around’s new brand guidelines. The site’s content structure will remain the same in this initial phase, with the addition of a searchable “resource directory” area that can be filtered by the location and occupation of the visitor (e.g. counselor or student).

Along with the migration and redesign of the site, the first phase of this project will add a subscription-based membership area for the resource directory, as well as a store for merchandise and a section to make donations.

The second phase will add a booking system for online and in-person courses. We will also investigate solutions for integrating a chatbot into the site.

# Timeline

The first phase of this project will launch on October 25th and the second phase will launch roughly three weeks later on November 12th.
